# Trophic_metacommunities_bromeliad


We use a food web module in bromeliad dwelling insects to investigate how the relative abundances in this module can be understood in terms of differences in the species spatial use properties.

This code generates all the figures and outputs for the box in: Towards a multi-trophic extension of metacommunity ecology.

The data can be found in: https://zenodo.org/record/1410460#.W5FF-i2ZPu0
